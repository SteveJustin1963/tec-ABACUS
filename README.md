# tec-ABACUS

Downgraded from IBM CPU to TEC-1 Abacus teaching tool.

Abacus IO; small magnets in the beads send position info from Hall effect transistors imbedded in the slide to the TEC. The TEC does the abacus calculation and reports back via tec-8x8 and or tec-SPEECH. This confirms the users operations.

Later, solenoids can move the abacus beads as well.
